This project is to devise a strategy to identify vessels that are loitering in a specific area known for smuggling. The approach is based on "Loitering behavior detection by spatiotemporal characteristics quantification based on the dynamic features of Automatic identification System (AIS) messages." by Wayan Mahardhika Wijaya and Yasuhiro Nakamura
